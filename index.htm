  <blockquote>
    Never has security been more in the news. Companies around the world know that they are
    going to have to prioritise identity and privacy within systems designs and processes,
    to ensure customers and clients are protected more than ever. While laws like the GDPR
    give us guidelines and recommendations on best practices for data collection and storage, 
    you need look no further than the Security, Identity, and Privacy Miniconf to level
    up your skills with talks and practical advice from professionals and thought leaders.
